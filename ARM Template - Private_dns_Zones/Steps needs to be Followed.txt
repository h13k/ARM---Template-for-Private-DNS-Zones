1. First Create 2-Vnet's.
 
2. Create a subnet in both of the Vnet's.

3. Spin Up 2-VM's of each subnet from both Vnet's.

4. Test whether logging to both VM's or not - If able to login, then proceed with dns zone creation.
				              If not able to login, then make sure there should be correct subnet associations for NSG's & NIC's.

	(Note: Make sure avoid associating multiple NSG's for a subnet, Try to apply single NSG for multiple VM's
	       Prefer to create Username & Passwords irrespective of any VM machine (windows & linux) instead of downloading pem or RDP Files
	       which gives a smooth login.) 

5. Then create a private DNS Zone and link mulitple Vnet's into DNS Zone.

	Please run the below commands on both the VM's:

		1. Sudo apt update,upgrade
		   sudo apt-get install firewalld   (# For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems)

		2. sudo systemctl enable firewalld
		   sudo systemctl start firewalld

		3. sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-protocol=icmp --permanent

		4. sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT

		5. sudo firewall-cmd --reload - (Optional)

6. By default after linking virtual Vnet's, DNS records will be created automatically for each VM.
   but make sure delete default DNS Records and create New DNS Records with same name add both the private Ip's of VM's into each record.
   so that finally we can able to ping over One to Another VM.
